# Data Visualization and Collection Tool

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to visualize and manage data from an Excel file. It supports data with URLs for images, allowing users to view the images and interact with the data using a collection system.

## Features

- **Excel Data Visualization**: Automatically displays data from an Excel file in a tabular format.
- **Image Integration**: Includes image URLs for a visual representation alongside data entries.
- **Collection Management**: Allows users to interact with a collection system using checkboxes, which dynamically update the data.
- **Pagination**: Supports paginated views to navigate through large datasets.
- **Excel Updates**: Changes made to the collection are directly saved back to the Excel file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Ensure your data file (`data.xlsx`) is formatted with the following columns:
   - `name` (string)
   - `image` (URL of the image)
   - `collect` (integer: `0` for unchecked, `1` for checked)

5. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Usage

1. **Viewing Data**: The application loads data from `data.xlsx` and displays it in a table format. Each row includes the name, image, and a checkbox for collection.
2. **Updating Collection**: Use the checkboxes to mark items as part of your collection. Changes are automatically saved to the Excel file.
3. **Navigation**: Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through pages of data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- pandas
- openpyxl (for Excel file manipulation)

## File Structure

```
your-repository/
│
├── app.py             # Main application code
├── data.xlsx          # Excel file with data to visualize
├── templates/
│   └── base.html      # Base HTML template
│   └── index.html     # Main HTML template
├── static/            # Static files (if needed for styling)
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Example Data Format

The `data.xlsx` file should be structured as follows:

| name      | image                     | collect |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------|
| Item 1    | http://example.com/image1 | 0       |
| Item 2    | http://example.com/image2 | 1       |

- **name**: A string representing the name of the item.
- **image**: A URL pointing to the item's image.
- **collect**: An integer (`0` or `1`) indicating whether the item is in the collection.

## Future Improvements

- Add advanced filtering and sorting options.
- Enable file upload to dynamically replace the data source.
- Enhance the UI for better usability and responsiveness.
